    Tarot

Tarot is certainly a film, though disjointed barely scratches the surface. Pacing is something
 the writers seem only vaguely familiar with, and emotional weight is glaringly absent
 throughout—even when a friend’s death is right before the characters' eyes. Did these 
characters meet a day before the events of the movie? The line delivery feels like it’s from Fiverr 
voice actors who didn’t get to hear the last voice line. Each sterile character is a dollar store 
version of every teen horror trope, and their dialogue is juvenile and stale. The setting is 
supposedly Boston, but with the lack of background characters, you might think it's the middle of 
nowhere. It’s as if they spent all their budget on getting Jacob Batalon from the new Spiderman 
movies and forgot to cast extras.
<br><br>
In the first 25 minutes, the movie throws you from a party at an Airbnb where they discover the 
titular tarot deck, then they segue into a romantic spat that seems endless that then abruptly 
jumps to a hotbox podcast session interrupted by a winning lottery ticket. From there, it’s into the 
first death, followed by an emotional support scene where everyone goes their separate 
ways—except for the tarot reader and one of the girls. Oddly, the tarot reader’s boyfriend from 
the earlier spat is still hanging around as if their argument had never happened. The movie then 
devolves from an already flimsy plot into a series of unearned kills. You might wonder what any 
of this has to do with tarot. After the second monster reveal, I wondered the same thing. The 
answer? Each kill is associated with a tarot card character, and the readings are somewhat 
literal—the reading of “leading down the wrong track” ends with the character being chased by 
the Hermit until he gets hit by a train.
<br><br>
The subsequent hour and seven minutes are as predictable as modern cheap thrills get: “Let’s 
Google it!” “Oh my god! This lady knows about our plight and can help! She spent her life 
researching after experiencing the same thing years ago!” “She lives in a creepy shack, a 
recluse from society! How spooky!” “She wasn’t going to help, but now she will—only in the form 
of a cryptic puzzle we must solve before it’s too late!” Although this formulaic approach has 
worked in some films—like Fear Street—combining it with contrived laziness makes this movie 
one you’re better off skipping.
<br><br>
The filmmakers got even lazier with setting up the kills before the hour mark passes, having the 
characters spell everything out for the audience. No misdirection or subtlety—just “My horoscope 
said this would happen!” followed by the movie delivering exactly that prediction. As a result, 
even the jump scares are telegraphed and fall flat. Continuing in this vein, we see the expert 
have her horoscope read, then get dragged off-screen with a notably impassive response. Abe 
“Criss Angel ‘Mindfreak’” Lincoln seeks revenge in a scene that could have been deeply 
uncomfortable but is rendered almost comical by directorial miscues and weak attempts at 
cheap scares. What should have been an emotional “will they, won’t they” moment falls flat, as 
the movie has made no effort to invest in the relationship enough to make it memorable. I don’t 
really care if they do or don’t get together because this is maybe the third time the movie has 
mentioned their relationship, and they’ve only shared about ten lines of shared dialogue.
<br><br>
The ending is somehow the most miserable part of this movie, in spite of impending respite. As 
is typical from these “by the numbers” thrillers, somebody has to make it out alive, right? Well, 
this movie is no different. Our tarot reader and her boyfriend magically escape this nightmare 
after a confusing sequence of events: homeboy gets defenestrated by the death card, who 
proceeds to chase the girlfriend through the house as she barricades herself in the closet. 
Meanwhile, the boyfriend gets dragged through the hallway towards a blaze fit for a crematorium. 
The bright idea strikes to read the haunting spirit’s horoscope, which is strange since she 
doesn’t know what sign this entity is and yet they had to have the astrological signs for each 
previous reading. Lame duck catchphrase to defeat the evil, and now the boyfriend and girlfriend 
are in the same room somehow? They exit the house and walk down the road until they’re 
spooked by none other than the Spiderman guy, who surprisingly didn’t die during his encounter 
with the fool (thanks roommate Todd). The trio ride off into the sunrise with baffling poise 
considering they just lost four close friends.

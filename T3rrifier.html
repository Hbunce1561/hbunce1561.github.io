    Terrifier 3

    <p2 class = "p2">
The third installment in Damien Leone’s Terrifier series shouldn’t surprise anyone with its
over-the-top gore and plethora of grotesque violence at this point. Though I’ve never been a big 
fan of the series or the gore-porn genre as a whole, I’ve somehow managed to watch the two 
other main entries and All Hallow’s Eve. I don’t like these movies—not strictly because of their 
unbridled obsession with visceral mutilation, but because each film has tried to outdo itself in 
absurdity, making a mockery of your time.
<br><br>
The first Terrifier was, admittedly, a tough watch. Even though I wasn’t thrilled by it, I could 
understand roughly what it set out to do and came away with an appreciation for Art, even if I 
have a distaste for the franchise as a whole.
<br><br>
After that, the producers took what could have been a grindhouse film and made a sort of 
meta-parody that didn’t land. At all. The second movie failed to create a compelling reason to 
continue watching after each subsequent kill, and in a few instances, outright refused to give a 
satisfying payoff to what should’ve been a bellowing crescendo. Narratively, it was as expected: 
weak, and a significant step back from the original.
<br><br>
So that brings us to this holiday horror flick. What is there to even say about this? For starters, 
the gore is even more outlandish than in the previous two films, which is saying a lot considering 
we've already seen two different ways to bifurcate a woman in the earlier entries. The first 
scene—a brutal murder of a family near Christmas—sets the tone for another two hours of cruel 
and unusual punishment. The movie continues into a title card, followed by a flashback 
sequence set five years prior, a few more one-off kills, Vicky going down the river à la 13 
Reasons Why, and finally (after 20 minutes), we return to our protagonist from the last film, 
Sienna Shaw.
<br><br>
At this point, to no one’s surprise, Sienna is in a psychiatric care facility—or more accurately, 
she’s leaving the facility to spend the holidays with Uncle Greg, Aunt Jessica, and cousin 
Gabbie.
<br><br>
The movie then does something rather unexpected for the series, making the next hour and a 
half quite campy and enjoyable. There are a few spots where I think Terrifier 3 still falls 
flat—don’t get me wrong. Jonathan’s character arc is a glaring weak point and feels unsatisfying 
in the resolution of his story. He serves as a bridge between Sienna and the rest of the world on 
the surface, but with suppressed knowledge of the intricacies of how Art works. I won’t go into 
too much detail, but suffice it to say, they underutilized him throughout the movie. Additionally, a 
little funkiness in pacing and chronology while trying to weave together Art’s return and Sienna’s 
sounding of the alarms adds a fog of confusion to the story being told.
<br><br>
As we march toward the film’s climactic end, I couldn’t help but draw parallels to Nightmare on 
Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. Actually, it was near identical to Dream Warriors in its final fight 
scene, bringing a quasi-whimsicality to what’s still a brutal sequence. Quite a memorable and fun 
scene to close out what has been a surprisingly cohesive film.
<br><br>
After all is said and done, where does this film leave us? It’s clear that Art isn’t done, but I think 
that’s hardly a surprise given his decapitation at the end of the last movie and the beginning of 
<br><br>
this one. Sienna clearly still has fight in her, but should the franchise continue down the 
“Halloween” formula, where Art and Vicky become hyper-fixated on Sienna, it must tread 
carefully so as to avoid feeling tired before it even begins. It also begs the question: how many 
times can Art be beaten? Is it like Freddy Krueger and Nancy Thompson, where she has to 
guide herself and others to victory based on her past knowledge, or can others defeat him on 
their own? Is Art still a compelling villain if he ends up getting his ass kicked in every movie?
<br><br>
In any case, this film is a surprising one for an avid hater like myself and is the only one in the 
series that I will not only give a positive review to, but one that actually left me wanting to watch it 
again. It’s not the best horror flick, but it’s certainly a strong showing in a genre that has seen 
better days. I understand what the first 20 minutes do for the plot, but honestly, it’s a better film if 
you’re not an edgy 13-year-old to just skip past them.
